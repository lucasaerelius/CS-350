# CS-350
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
A smart home thermostat prototype was developed as part of the project. It features a set point that triggers its shut-off mechanism when reached. Additionally, two buttons on each side facilitate increasing or decreasing the temperature set point.
# What did you do particularly well?
Initially, grasping the concept of state machines proved to be a challenge. However, through this project, I have gained a good amount of insight over state machines, especially their logic in regulating the on/off function of the thermostat.
# Where could you improve?
Rather than a specific aspect, comprehending the system as a whole is what matters most to me. Although I was able to complete the assignment with my existing knowledge, I aim to delve deeper into these systems' intricacies. I believe dedicating more time to this would have significantly enhanced the project's outcome.
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
This course has equipped me with a new skillset, wherein everything I learned was like a new tool. I had no prior knowledge of embedded systems, but now I am eager to construct more such systems. I find that online forums are still an excellent resource to address any coding-related queries.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Familiarity with state machines and an overall understanding of how embedded systems operate would be valuable knowledge to possess.
# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To ensure clarity and ease of understanding, I made a conscious effort to comment my code wherever possible and arranged it in a manner that enables anyone to comprehend what's happening with minimal effort.
